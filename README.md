# ALX-Printf-Project
ALX Printf Project cohort 14

This is a project collaboration between Chibuzor Uzondu and Abdul-Azeez Halimah.
A function named "_printf" is created to imitate the actual "printf" command located in the stdio.h library. It contains some of the basic features and functions of the "printf" command.

_printf() is a function that performs formatted output conversion and prints data. The given prototype is:

	int _printf(const char *format, ...)

Where **format** contains the string that is printed. Because _printf() is a variadic function, it receives n arguments replaced by n tags written inside the string.
